## Hey! I'm Elizabeth

I'm a curious individual and just a _tiny bit_ obsessed with frontend development and making the web accessible—no big deal! 
In my role as a Frontend Developer at [Workshop Orange](https://hello.workshoporange.co/), I contribute to delivering exceptional user experiences while ensuring high-quality and scalable solutions. My core areas of expertise include accessibility, scalability, and interactive design. Beyond tech, I'm basically a plant-hoarding goblin plotting a mini jungle that will someday take over my living room.
